# Deployed Wordpress website on AWS EC2 Instance Using LEMP Stack

This project demonstrates how to deploy a fully functional WordPress website on an AWS EC2 instance using the LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP). It covers everything from launching an EC2 instance to installing and configuring the necessary components, setting up the WordPress CMS, and securing the deployment. 



## What is Wordpress ?

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) that allows users to create and manage websites, blogs, and online stores. It is highly customizable with a vast array of plugins and themes, making it easy for users to create unique and professional-looking websites without needing extensive technical skills.


## Project Objective :

- Set up and deploy a WordPress website using an AWS EC2 instance.

- Install and configure Apache, MySQL, and PHP on a Linux server.

- Download, install, and configure WordPress with a custom database and user.

- Set proper file and directory permissions for WordPress functionality.

- Configure Nginx to handle PHP using PHP-FPM and reload services.

## Summary :

In this project, we successfully deployed a WordPress website on an AWS EC2 instance using the LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP). I started by launching a server on AWS, then installed and configured all the necessary software to run WordPress.

Using the LEMP stack helped make the website fast and efficient. AWS provided a reliable and flexible cloud platform to host the site. This project helped me learn how to manage a web server, install WordPress, and understand how cloud hosting works.

Overall, it was a great hands-on experience that improved my skills in web hosting, server setup, and working with cloud services.
